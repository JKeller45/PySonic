# Introducing PySonic

## About

PySonic is an easy to use python application that create reactive video from an audio input. With an efficient render pipeline with multithreading, it is capable of rendering high quality video very quickly. Some features include:

- Reactive frequency band bars or waveform
- Solid color, static image, or video backgrounds
- Zoom and "snow" effects
- AI Super Sampling
- Lots of accepted audio and video formats with ffmpeg
- Fast rendering with multithreading
- Different bar placement locations
- Variable frame rate, resolution, and length

PySonic was created as a replacement for Sonic Candle, a similar application built in Java that was orphaned years ago. The purpose was to improve on some issues with Sonic Candle, like lack of support for a wide range of audio and video formats, while bringing it up to date with a faster render pipeline.
